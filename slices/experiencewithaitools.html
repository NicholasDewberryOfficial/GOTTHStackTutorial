        Alright, this is gonna be pretty strange, but hey - AI is a pretty big
        topic nowadays. I like to use it for the following use cases:
    </p>
    <ol class="gap-8 list-decimal">
        <li>
            Generating HTML + Tailwind boilerplate (Simple, GPT does this SUPER
            well)
        </li>
        <li>
            Rubber-duck debugging by talking to me when I find problems (A
            little harder, and even though GPT is a little bit more mixed on
            this, I find that every now and again it comes up with a genius
            solution),
        </li>
        <li>
            Proofreading/Rewording my tutorial content (Simple, GPT does well)
        </li>
        <li>
            Doing find+replace in tailwind .css laden html code to change
            classes (Simple but tedious, the more context the better)
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving me design feedback/considerations for ideas I have (For this
            blog, it gave me the idea to center everything, and use a 2-tone
            color style).
        </li>
        <li>Giving me basic snippets for tutorial purposes.</li>
        <li>Commenting my code once I give it context.</li>
        <li>
            Find and replace for more complicated portions. Sometimes, it
            hallucinates and does more than what you want - but most of the time
            you can give it more context to solve that problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simple, isolated and easily testable functions. For example, for one
            of my data processing projects I used it to read in files that end
            in .txt and it returned the output with no side effects.
        </li>
    </ol>
    ---------------------------------------- <br /><br />
    Here's what I DON'T use it for: <br /><br />
    ----------------------------------------
    <ol class="gap-4 list-decimal">
        <li>
            Generating the Go main code for me. I can do it myself, and you
            can't use AI to create Go boilerplate the same way you can use it
            for HTML. It gets complicated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generating complex fucntions. It doesn't get what I want, and
            sometimes it implements imports I tell it not to use. Remember, a
            lot of Go web code that chatgpt uses is based off of using
            frameworks and custom routes. In a more egrigious case, GPT started
            trying to add react components to my page and wouldn't stop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generating htmx. It doesn't work, and it really suffers to link two
            seperate components/files together. I think it suffers from having
            seperated contexts. With that being said - you may have some luck in
            a few spots.
        </li>
    </ol>
