  <h1></h1>
  To put it simply: the larger javascript ecosystem is a mess. Dependencies upon dependencies, dual-code systems, hidden errors, performance issues - there's a lot to talk about. <br> <br> To solve these issues, people create frameworks (and then more frameworks to fix issues of past frameworks), or they use tools like Django to handle full stack development.
  <br>
  <br><br> Out of all of the full-stack frameworks, the GOTTH stack is one of the simpliest, easiest, and is customizable. <b> <u> If you want something that "just works" use GOTTH.</u> </b> Even though, you're using multiple tools, they all fit together neatly, and you can start cooking ASAP. <br><br> </p>

  <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      Whether youâ€™re transitioning from a heavy JavaScript
      framework or trying to create a fresh, developer-friendly
      approach to web apps, GOTTH provides a robust environment to
      keep your codebase organized and your workflow efficient.

      And even if you just want to learn - welcome to the club! <b> A TON of the logic that you will learn here (templating, HTMX) is transferrable to other frameworks/web development projects.</b>
