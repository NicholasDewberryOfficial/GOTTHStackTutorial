<h1 text-3xl>About the author: (Warning: personal opinion)</h1>
<p>
    Hey, Dewberry speaking here. I started my SWE journey as a bad indie gamedev
    and as a decent Undergrad Researcher. I can follow obselete YT tutorials
    deprecated for Unity features, as well as 20 page scientific papers where
    they speak like English majors trying to hit the word count. I got an A in
    my web development and javascript course. I can create web pages, I
    understand HTML/CSS + regular JS + JQuery quite well - but once I hit the
    "Advanced React" wall I lose all motivation. <br /><br />
    As an entry level SWE, I loathe the current web ecosystem. I either have to
    learn react - an ailing technology with little transferrable skills and a
    whole heap of problems - or some other solution that tries to fix the
    problems of React and ends up creating more.
    <br /><br />
    My skill is in designing complex systems and implementing them efficiently.
    The less that gets in the way of that, the better.
    <br /><br />
    I came across the GOTTH stack after spending 30 or so hours on a doomed
    React project and getting annoyed. To be fair, I did make a lot of design
    mistakes when creating the system - but I could easily change around
    structs/process .json differently, while the React web became untenable for
    me.
    <br /><br />
    I started this website after working on another GOTTH social media website
    and realized there were no good tutorials. So here we are.

    <br /><br />
    BTW, I got everything on this website ready in ~8 hours. 3 of those hours
    involved fighting google cloud to CI/CD my repo correctly.
