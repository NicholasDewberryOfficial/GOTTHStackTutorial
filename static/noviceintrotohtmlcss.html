                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational
                    languages of the web. HTML defines the structure and content of a page (think of it as
                    the “skeleton” of your website), while CSS is used to control the layout, colors, and
                    overall visual presentation (the “skin and clothes” of your skeleton).
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed"> To give another crappy example, HTML is what you read, and CSS makes it look good.  </p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed"> AI is ABSURDLY good at working with HTML/CSS. I'm guessing that since everything is relatively static and because there's a ton of training data, AI can very quickly spin up boilerplate for you to fill in. Still - there's no excuse for not knowing your basics.</p>

                    Below are a few recommended resources to quickly get you up to speed. Pick whichever
                    feels most comfortable (or combine them!), and in no time you’ll be styling pages
                    like a pro.
