                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Tailwind CSS is a framework that you can use to quickly and easily modify how HTML elements look.
                    You can do a wide variety of things; from simply changing text/background color to adding columns and grid layouts.
                    You can even add animations, shadows, filters and borders to objects too. It's an extremely deep frontend tool you can use
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    By default, Tailwind includes a wide range of utility classes for things like padding,
                    margin, color, and typography. This approach keeps your styles consistent and predictable,
                    plus you can still customize or extend Tailwind to match your exact needs.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Working in the GOTTH stack, we use Tailwind to make sure everything looks good. It's not for interactivity (it can be) or programming - it's solely for visual flair.
