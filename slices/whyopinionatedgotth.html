<h1 text-3xl>About the author: (Warning: personal opinion)</h1>
                <p>
                    Hey, Dewberry speaking here. I started my SWE journey as a
                    bad indie gamedev and as a decent Undergrad Researcher. I
                    can follow obselete YT tutorials deprecated Unity features,
                    as well as 20 page scientific papers where they speak like
                    English majors trying to hit the word count. I got an A in
                    my comp 322 web developent and javascript courses. I can
                    create web pages, I understand HTML/CSS + regular JS +
                    JQuery quite well - but once I hit the "Advanced React" wall
                    I lose all motivation. <br /><br />
                    As an entry level SWE, I loathe the current web ecosystem. I
                    either have to learn react - an ailing technology with
                    little transferrable skills and a whole heap of problems -
                    or some other solution that tries to fix the problems of
                    React and ends up creating more.
                    <br /><br />
                    My skill is in designing complex systems and making them
                    work. The less that gets in the way of that, the better.
                    <br /><br />
                    I came across the GOTTH stack after spending 30 or so hours
                    on a doomed React project and getting annoyed. To be fair, I
                    did make a lot of design mistakes when creating the system -
                    but I could easily change around structs/process .json
                    differently, while the React web became untenable for me.
                    <br /><br />
                    I started this website after working on another GOTTH social
                    media website and realized there were no good tutorials. So
                    here we are.
