                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    htmx is a small JavaScript library that allows you to add dynamic features to
                    your web pages without writing lots of client-side JavaScript. Basically, you can use html to send
                    data and requests over to the backend - which can in turn html to dynamically render new stuff.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Have you seen the teal blue buttons in the site? We use htmx for that. Below is an example of this. To summarize what's happening in the below example:
                    <br> <br>
                    -The button is set up to swap out its html when clicked
                    <br>
                    -The user clicks the button, and the frontend sends a request to the backend
                    <br>
                    -the backend recognizes this, and sends html data back
                    <br> <br>
                    This isn't a very complex example, but it's great thing to learn from. <a class="text-blue-300" href="https://github.com/NicholasDewberryOfficial/GOTTHStackTutorial/blob/main/static/novicehtmx.html"> Click here to look at the code!</a>
