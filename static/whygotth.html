                        Go. A straightforward and popular language for data processing, backend applications and MORE (seriously, it's good in a boring way).
                    </li>
                    <li> Tailwind css. An easy way to make your website look good using class selectors. Good for people with the design skills of a toddler (You've seen my art on the front page. I know you did.). </li>
                    <li>
                    html/template. A simple way to load up html files and render them for the user. You can also feed in custom information, allowing for extremely dynamic websites (I.E showing a social media post and its associated comments, or scrubbing swear words from an database message and rendering it to html.)
                    </li>
                    <li> net/http. Create a robust and customizable server. </li>
                    <li> HTMX. Handle AJAX requests and frontend/backend communication simply using HTML.</li>
                </ul>

                To put it simply: the larger javascript ecosystem is a mess. Dependencies upon dependencies, dual-code systems, hidden errors, performance issues - there's a lot to talk about. <br> <br> To solve these issues, people create frameworks (and then more frameworks to fix issues of past frameworks), or they use tools like Django to handle full stack development.
                <br>
                <br><br> Out of all of the full-stack frameworks, the GOTTH stack is one of the simpliest, easiest, and is customizable. <b> <u> If you want something that "just works" use GOTTH.</u> </b> Even though, you're using multiple tools, they all fit together neatly, and you can start cooking ASAP. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Whether youâ€™re transitioning from a heavy JavaScript
                    framework or trying to create a fresh, developer-friendly
                    approach to web apps, GOTTH provides a robust environment to
                    keep your codebase organized and your workflow efficient.

                    Well, every developer who's trying to create responsive, high quality web apps.

                    This tutorial is centered around people who are beginning their developer journey (students, hobbyists). If you're more skilled, make sure to skip around.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
               Backend developers and data scientists will find this stack to be easy to work with.
               You can focus on features and functionality over ricing the way your website looks/interacts.

                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed"> In a world where AI is getting increasingly better for coding tasks, the GOTTH stack is uniquely effective. My typical workflow is to ask Chad Gippity for html+taiilwind css boilerplate, and then manually add in htmx/relevant template data. It's a super fast workflow. If you have any issues, you only really need to send small snippets over to chatGPT to get the problems identified.   </p>

                    GOTTH might be the perfect fit.

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li> No Javascript, and no Javascript ecosystem. Even though you use 2 js libraries - you don't need to write any js code yourself, and both libraries have great documentation/support.</li>
                        <li>Go is a fast powerhouse of a language with a ton of features and great documentation. </li>
                        <li>Minimal JavaScript thanks to HTMX, minimal Frontend thanks to TailwindCSS.</li>
                        <li>Advanced front-end features like animations, panels and more from Tailwind.</li>
                        <li>
                            Templates allow an extremely easy way to create custom HTML pages, and populate them with the necessary information.
                        </li>
                        <li> HTMX lets you implement APIs and dynamic features quickly.  </li>
                        <li> Database Agnostic. I like Mongodb, but you can easily swap it for something else using the necessary Go drivers/modules/scripts. </li>
                        <li> Deployment agnostic. We go over using docker, but you can </li>
                        <li> Extensible backend. Want to add live reload (air) or debugging (delve)? Go right ahead.</li>
                        <li> Extensible frontend. Can't live without (insert frontend library here)? Well, with some tweaking you can get it working.</li>
                            <li> It teaches you a lot about web development, without being overwhelming. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>
                            Less conventional than popular JS frameworks, so
                            smaller community and less online support. ChatGPT is good with dealing with individual parts (the Go code, the HTMX code, Tailwind styling) but struggles to "bring it all together".
                        </li>
                        <li>An intense learning curve - none of this is taught in University classes, and this is all extremely diferent from typical development methods. With that being said - efficiency and simplicity is one of the benefits of the GOTTH stack, and once you get over the hurdle, you'll find everything is smoother than React/Next.js. </li>
                        <li>
                            HTMX might lack some advanced features that large JS
                            frameworks provide. (I need examples, pls give me some in the github repo).
                        </li>
                        <li> Tailwind css encourages "copy+paste development" with many repeated sections. </li>
                    <button> Why not just use DaisyUI? </button>
                        <li> Debugging is hard - we're using so many interconnected technologies, and identifying which one is giving us the issue can be difficult. </li>
                        <li> While a lot of the logic should apply between development projects (templating, AJAX requests, backend request handling) a lot of it is domain-specific to GOTTH. This means that you might be annoyed if you go back to your React day job after being exposed to GOTTH.</li>
