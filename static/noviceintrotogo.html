                    A Short Introduction to Go

                    Go (also known as Golang) is a statically typed, compiled
                    programming language created by Google. Known for its
                    simplicity, concurrency features, and efficient performance,
                    Go aims to make developers more productive without
                    sacrificing speed or clarity.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    In the GOTTH stack, Go serves as the backbone for
                    server-side logic, template rendering, and routing,
                    providing the speed and reliability that power efficient web
                    applications.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Now, Go is a pretty straightforward language, but it's got
                    some tricky elements.

                        This tutorial assumes that you understand the basics (The := walrus, error handling, modules and imports) but if you don't, click one of the following links:

                    <ul class="text-blue-100 gap-4">
                    <li> <a class="text-blue-300" href="https://go.dev/tour/list"> The official tour of Go. </a> (My favorite) It's a set of tutorials with interactive elements, and it's extremely helpful for learning. </li> <br><br>
                    <li> <a class="text-blue-300" href="https://gobyexample.com/hello-world"> Go by example. </a> This is a little bit less involved, but still teaches you everything with clear examples.  </li><br><br>
                    <li> <a class="text-blue-300" href="https://roadmap.sh/golang"> The Golang roadmap.sh page.</a> Now, this is way more involved and rigorous compared to the other choices, and is aimed towards industry professionals. I'd reccomend doing the "learn the basics" section and stopping there. </a> </li><br><br>
                    <li> <a class="text-blue-300" href="https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/"> The leetcode 75.</a> Despite being a little less practical (Shots fired! Shots fired!)
                        and despite it being much more involved than the other choices, you can still learn a lot about how go "Feels" and "Functions" through this. I reccomend doing 10 easy problems. If you're having trouble, search for Python/Rust/C answers, and then implement it using Go.</li><br><br>
