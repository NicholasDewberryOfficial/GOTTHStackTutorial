# GOTTHStackTutorial
Hello! Welcome to my GOTTH stack tutorial. I made this as a central repo for GOTTH stack work, and for everything that's relevant.

Tech used: Go, Tailwind, HTMX, Go Templates deployed onto Google cloud (using CI/CD and cloud build).

Time taken: Mar 3rd - Mar 8th (maybe 40-50 hours), with most of that being spent on content. The actual logic behind the code works perfectly well, and it all comes together smoothly.

It's got a lot of information, and touches on a ton of different topics.

TODO: (I NEED CONTRIBUTORS!... I don't have any money tho Q.Q ).
1. Look over the links in the novice sections, and add more relevant ones. Any reccomendations?
2. Formatting and proofreading. I made some blurbs and had chatGPT reword them into something simple and straightforward.
3. Find bugs in code (works on my machine - at least until i told GPT to redo it).
4. Implement advanced sections.
5. (Difficult) Light mode revamp. We'd have to go through ALL the .html files and revamp the classes to enable light mode. Now, this is possible using an LLM to handle the find and replace - but it'll take a bit.
6. (Impossible) An "Idiomatic" or "best practices" section where we discuss the best way to do things in terms of perfomance and flexibility. This would include discussions and code examples.
7. (Tedious) Fix all the buttons in the pages to have them link to other ones.
8. (?? Easy or hard IDK) Side bar for other tutorials in a specific section.
9. (Easy, but takes a bit) Changing all parsetemplates functions to instead parseglob
10. (Hard, for me at least) Change installing js scripts from CDN to installing from a static location

-How do I run this?
Easy.
-Download this project as a zip, and unzip it
-Open the folder in terminal
-"go mod tidy" and "go run ."
boom. there u go. Can't run? LMK!
