        I started my Go journey in Spring 2024, and I started making web apps in
        Summer 2024. Before then it was necessary to use a framework (such as
        Fiber or Chi) to do anything web-related.

    These frameworks were extremely well-written and had many QOL features that
    made them from stand out from one another, as well as special use cases that
    they all covered well.
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        However - in 2025, and for most people, I reccomend against using a web
        framework. Net/Http has come a long way (It got REALLY good in Spring
        2024) and you don't need all of the bloat that comes from a typical web
        framework. They also solve problems that are really
        <b> valuable </b> for you to solve yourself. For example, CSRF attacks
        are pretty common - but you can use a middleware like gorilla/mux to
        highlight specific portions rather than just relying on built-in
        functionality. Also, writing boilerplate code might be inelegant - but
        it helps you to understand what's going on at a granular level.
        <br /><br />
        Phlisophically, Idiomatic Go prefers limiting the use of imports -
        especially those that are from outside of the default Go registy. It
        helps to make building and debugging easier, and it just makes things
        simpler in the long run.
        <br /><br />
        With that being said, there are a ton of benefits to using frameworks.
        For one, the documentation is much better - but it fundementally comes
        down to what you want. Are you someone who's learning to sharpen their
        skills in Go? Then I don't reccomend it. Up against a deadline, and you
        need a batteries included solution? You might want to consider Chi.

        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, a lot of the skills that you get from net/http and
        frameworks are extremely transferrable, and you can change your mind
        whenever you like.
